YAML for Java. A [user-friendly](http://www.baeldung.com/design-a-user-friendly-java-library) OOP library. Based on [spec 1.2](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html).

From the [specification](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html): **YAML™** (rhymes with “camel”) is a human-friendly, cross language, Unicode based data serialization language.

To get the latest release, simply add the following to your ``pom.xml``: 

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.amihaiemil.web</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

or download the <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/repositories/releases/content/com/amihaiemil/web/camel/1.0.2/camel-1.0.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar">fat</a> jar.


## Usage

The API of this library is clean, intuitive and generally close to the ``javax.json`` API that most developers are used to:

## Building and printing Yaml:

```java
YamlMapping yaml = Yaml.createYamlMappingBuilder()
    .add("architect", "amihaiemil")
    .add(
        "devops",
        Yaml.createYamlSequenceBuilder()
            .add("rultor")
            .add("0pdd")
            .build()
    ).add(
        "developers",
        Yaml.createYamlSequenceBuilder()
            .add("amihaiemil")
            .add("salikjan")
            .add("SherifWally")
            .build()
    ).build();
```

``toString()`` methods are overriden to pretty-print the yaml, so the above ``yaml.toString()`` will print (notice that the elements are sorted alphabetically, 
even though it is not required by the YAML specification):

```yaml
architect: amihaiemil
developers: 
  - SherifWally
  - amihaiemil
  - salikjan
devops: 
  - 0pdd
  - rultor
```

## Reading:

Reading a Yaml input is very straight-forward, as outlined bellow. There is one **important** aspect: the input has to be
a valid (well-indented) Yaml, otherwise you will get an exception, at some point, when trying to work with the read object!

```java
//createYamlInput is overloaded to accept also String InputStream
YamlMapping yamlMapping = Yaml.createYamlInput(new File("mapping.yml"))
    .readYamlMapping();

YamlSequence yamlSequence = Yaml.createYamlInput(new File("sequence.yml"))
    .readYamlSequence();
```

## Parsing a Pojo:

Pojos can be parsed ("dumped") into Yaml as follows (attributes need to have getters and setters): 

```java
Map<String, Integer> grades = new HashMap<>();
grades.put("Math", 9);
grades.put("CS", 10);
YamlMapping studentYaml = new YamlObjectDump(
    new Student ("John", "Doe", 20, grades)
).represent();
```

``studentYaml.toString()`` will print:

```yaml
age: 20
firstName: John
grades: 
  CS: 10
  Math: 9
lastName: Doe
```

You can also parse maps (``Map<Object, Object>``) and collections (``Collection<Object>``) using ``YamlMapDump`` and ``YamlCollectionDump`` respecitvely
